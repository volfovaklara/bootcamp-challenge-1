# Challenge 1

[Deployed Application]()

### Description
This challenge was on on-the-job tickets, which means we've begun with starter code that we needed to modify. We've taken the existing code and refactored it to meet a certain set of standards. In this challenge, a marketing agency has hired us to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.
